## Introduction

Equalita Care is a mobile application dedicated to advancing gender equality and empowering women and girls worldwide. It aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5) - "Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls."

## Problem Statement

SDG 5 comprises nine targets and 14 indicators, including ensuring universal access to reproductive rights and health (Target 5.6). Equalita Care addresses Indicator 5.6.1, which focuses on enabling women aged 15â€“49 to make informed decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use, and reproductive health care. Additionally, it contributes to Indicator 5.6.2 by promoting laws and regulations that guarantee equal access to sexual and reproductive health care, information, and education for individuals aged 15 and older, regardless of gender.

## Application Overview

Equalita Care is a mobile application designed to educate and provide essential resources related to sexual and reproductive health care. The application consists of three main parts:

1. **Simple**: This section offers educational content to users, aiming to provide equal access to knowledge about sexual and reproductive health care. It educates both men and women on important topics, fostering awareness and understanding.

2. **Moderate**: The moderate part of the application features a map that displays clinics and health centers nearby. Users can find essential health services, get directions to these facilities, and access additional information, promoting access to quality care.

3. **Complex**: In the complex section, users can engage in a crossword game that allows them to practice and reinforce the knowledge gained from the lessons. Upon completing the game, the application provides feedback, indicating which lessons users should revisit for a deeper understanding.

**Note**: Please be aware that the application is still under development, and not all functionalities may be fully operational.
